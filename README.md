## Dependencies

The versions are purely orientative. It's just what I had when I wrote it and tested it. It probably works with older versions too. Open an issue if you tested it on an older version of any of those and I'll update the dependencies.

```
bash==5.1.8
wget==1.21
mpv==0.33.1

probably already installed:
libavutil==56.70.100
libavcodec==58.134.100
libavformat==58.76.100
libswscale==5.9.100
libavfilter==7.110.100
libswresample==3.9.100
ffmpeg==4.4-6ubuntu5

```

Work in progress...
